I started working very late - I had to jump a call with an oldie.

I worked only on the Signup component

# New thing learnt

## Bootstrap (not a new thing per se just the first time I am using it in react and the first time in a long time)

- __Installation__
```shell
npm i bootstrap react-bootstrap
```
- __Usage__

Within a component
```javascript
import {Card, Button, Form} from "bootstrap"

function Component(){
    <Card>
        <Card.Body>
            <Form>
                <Form.Group id="email">
                    <Form.Label>Email</Form.Label>
                    <Form.Control type="email" required ref={emailRef}>
                </Form.Group>
                <Button type="submit">Sign up</Button>
            </Form>
        </Card>
        </Card.Body>
}
```

Style
_(this should be imported at the root level (e.g index.js))_
```javascript
import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
```
