I fumbled around a bit with the PrivateRoute component but I guess that's why I am doing this from scratch right. So here is what I will do, after implementing the password reset feature tomorrow. I will then rewrite the AuthContext and PrivateRoute components tomorrow as those were the major things I fumbled with. So as a reminder here is what the private route should look like

```
import React from "react"
import {useAuth} from "../contexts/AuthContext"
import {Redirect, Route} from "react-router-dom"

const PrivateRoute = ({component:Component, ...rest}) => {

const {currentUser} = useAuth()

return <Route {...rest} render={(props) => currentUser ? <Component /> : <Redirect to="/login"> } >
}
```


## What I did
- Signup
- Login
