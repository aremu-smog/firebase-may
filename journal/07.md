I was a bit more relaxed today and really looked forward to the session

# New things learnt

## Private Routes
These are routes that are accessible only when a user is logged in. If a user attempts to access this route, they are redirected to the login page


- Create a PrivateRoute.js file
- The Private Route component is essentially a wrapper for the Route so it accepts the component and any other parameter you would normally pass to the route
```
import {Route} from "react-router-dom"

const PrivateRoute = ({component: Component, ...rest}) => {
    return <Route {...rest} render={(props) => <Component {...props}/>}></Route>
}
```
- The above will of course not work as desired, we need to check if the use is logged in, if the user is logged in, we render Component or else we redirect
```
import {useAuth} from ".../contexts/AuthContext"
import {Redirect} from "react-router-dom"

const PrivateRoute = ({component: Component, rest}) => {
    const {currentUser} = useAuth()

    return <Route {...rest} render = {(props) => currentUser ? <Component {...props} /> : <Redirect to="/login">}></Route>
}
```

## Password Reset
- In AuthContext.js, add a new passwordReset method
```
import {auth} from "./firebase"

const passwordReset =(email) => {
    auth.sendPasswordReset(email)
}
```
