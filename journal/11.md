I actually couldn't get firebase work in [day 10](10.md) - major issue was with installation to solve this, I had to do

```
npm cache clean --force
```
I found the solution [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61285627/cant-install-firbase-in-react-project)

The next thing was the firebase intialiazation - the entire website was returning a blank screen - apparently this was due to the fact that firebase was not picking up values from the ENV file and since the AuthProvider heavily relies on firebase, the entire website itself wasn't coming up. The issues
1. I didn't place the .env file in the correct location: I had put it in src/ but it was supposed to be in the root folder
2. I didn't add REACT_APP_ in front of each variable - this is very important.

## What I did
- created four methods I will be needing: resetPassword, signup, logout and login within `AuthContext.js`
- Implemented the logout feature
