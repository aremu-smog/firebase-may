# Overview
At my day job, I work majorly with Frontend pulling data from a CMS like WordPress. I have never for once had to work with things like Authentication, Authorization and so on. In order better position myself, I will be dedicating an hour each weekday in the month of May to learn various firebase tools.

Each tool will be in a separate branch listed below. I will be using ReactJS as the frontend Framework throughout the project.

# Branches
- [Authentication](/tree/auth)

Cheers!
